**Dairy Farm Management System**
This project is a comprehensive Dairy Farm Management System designed to streamline the management of a dairy farm's herd, health, breeding, milk production, and overall operations. The system provides a user-friendly dashboard to monitor key aspects of farm management, including cows, bulls, heifers, lactating cows, health status, breeding status, and milk production data. It integrates different management modules, such as herd management, health monitoring, fertility management, and milk & weight tracking, to ensure the smooth running of farm activities. The project leverages PHP and MySQL to handle backend functionalities, with dynamic data queries that populate the dashboard with real-time insights about the farmâ€™s livestock and operations.

_**Features include:**_

    Overview of cows, bulls, and heifers on the farm.
    Tracking of healthy cows and bulls.
    Monitoring of lactating cows and milk production.
    Health, breeding, and treatment status for animals.
    Detailed records and reports for farm management.

This project aims to enhance farm productivity and decision-making through data-driven insights and real-time monitoring of livestock health and performance.
